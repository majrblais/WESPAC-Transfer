# WESPAC-Transfer
---
This repo is used to transfer WESP-AC 3.2 files to a new version (named 3.3 or 3.4). The code requires an empty 3.3/.4 version and a filled 3.2 version.
It takes the `OF`, `F` and `S` sheets and transfer them into the newer versions. The passwords for the sheets are required and a prompt will appear.

## Future work
Add automatic password, currently not added due to the repo being public
